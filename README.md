# Propagation Regularization of Graph Neural Networks 

## Introduction

This repository was made for me and [Rasmus Aagaard](https://github.com/rasgaard)s project in the course 02640 Advanced Machine Learning. In this project, investigated propagation regularization for graph neural networks, which was introduced in the paper [*Rethinking Graph Regularization for Graph Neural Networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02027) by [Han Yang](https://github.com/yang-han/). 

## Installation and running the scripts on DTU HPC

For our project, we ran all of the experiments on the DTU HPC cluster. In order to get it set up, we wrote down a few of our steps in the [steps.txt](https://github.com/vstenby/02460GraphRegularization/blob/main/steps.txt) file. 

## Reproducing Results

To ease reproducability, we did all of our experiments using Weights and Biases. The project space can be found [here](https://wandb.ai/wakewordteam/02460AdvancedML).
